# DDR4-Memory-Controller
The simulation of a memory controller capable of serving the  shared last level cache of a four core 3.2 GHz processor employing a single memory channel. 
The system uses a relaxed consistency (XC) model. The memory channel is populated by a single-ranked 8GB PC4-25600 DIMM (constructed with memory chips 
organized as x8 devices with a 2KB page size and 24-24-24 timing). There is no ECC.
