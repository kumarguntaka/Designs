Welcome to the Designs repository! This repository serves as a hub for multiple design projects in my profile, each organized as a submodule. The projects are primarily focused on digital, mixed signal and analog designs, using various simulation tools to develop and verify.


Contributions are welcome! If you have ideas for new designs or improvements to existing ones, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
